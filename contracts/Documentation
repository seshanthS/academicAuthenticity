As per my understanding, The objectives are,
Make the certificates verifiable.
Prevent Tampering.
These can be achieved by,

When certificate generation,
  Step 1 :The signer Enters certificate details such as certificate number, Name of the candidate, CGPA 
  in the webUI.
  
  step 2 :The data entered is signed using signer's private Key. 
    var signature = {The output from above step}

  step 3 :broadcast() function in smartContract is invoked. It emits a event.
  parameter1: certificate number.
  parameter2: signature.
  parameter3: address of the signer. This paramerter is important for verification, Because the signer account might in change
  in future. [signedBy]

For Verification:
  The employer enters the details in the certificate into the webUI.
  var data = {employer enters the data}
  working:
    1. getPastEvents(), filterd by certificate No.
    2. get the signature, signedBy from the event.
    3. web3.eth.personal.ecRecover(data, signature)
    4. compare output of 'ecRecover()' and 'signedBy' from the event. If both are same, the cerificate is
       verified.
